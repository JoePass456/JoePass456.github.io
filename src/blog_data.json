            "Was my first week what I expected? Yes and no. Yes in terms of the fact that I had had a taste of what the bootcamp would be like in the course of completing the application project. In this project, I was tasked with using HTML to create a simple website with some basic text and images. Instead of detailed instructions, I was provided with links to sites that would provide the information I needed in order to complete each goal. The first week was similar to that except that the list of resources was far larger and the tasks much more complex. The major difference is that now I had the advantage of being able to access the instructers, Ian and Justin, as well as any if the 13 other students, for guidance or help via a program called Slack, an instant messaging system similar to an always-online chatroom.",
            "Were there struggles? Yes. The only way that the first week was NOT what I expected was in the sheer volume of content. It was definitely overwhelming, and while I was advised to expect up to 20 hours of work in the first week, it was certainly possible to spend far more time combing through the several seemingly bottomless links that were given as resources. In fact, I had to make a special effort to stay on task, as the material lends itself to wondering down rabbit holes. While this did lead to a bit of frustration, guidance was never far away. Also helpful was the daily check-in online conference calls which gave me chance to explain where I was having difficulty and learn from the experiences of other students. Overall, while I felt very challanged, I knew that I had help waiting in the wings if I did manage to get too deep in the weeds.",

            "Week two is pretty much in the books. This week the main focus was on psuedocoding. This is a process of planning out your actual code in a more structured manner. This can be done with plain text or in a graphical format such as a flowchart, whether on computer or on a dry erase board. This allows the programmers to break the software into bite sized pieces that can be attacked one at a time instead of just jumping Rambo-style into the code without any plan.",
            "We also learned about the Agile philosophy, which is way to interact with your team and clients in a way that keeps the project moving steadily forward, and MoSCoW, which is a way to look at a program through the prism of what it Must do, what it Should do, what it Could do, and what it Won't do. This makes you look at your work in a more pragmatic fashion, so you prioritize getting the software up and running, and also helps you to figure out what features are going to be within the scope of the project, versus what might have to wait.",
            "What I've struggled with this week as much as anything else is simply managing my time. A week is not a long time, and if you have a couple of days where you don\"t get much accomplished, it can have you straining to catch up. Also, as we get closer to being fulltime in the classroom, I really want to be getting into the 8 to 5 schedule now, so it won\"t be a shock to my system when we do get to that stage."

            "This week started with Labor Day, which gave me a nice day to spend with family, but also meant that I was starting one day behind. This meant that I had to spend a lot of extra time to keep caught up with the material. While we had a lot of HTML and CSS to work on this week, the main focus was on Javascript(JS).",
            "I had only barely worked with JS before, but it does remind me a bit of working with BASIC way back in the 90\"s, in that it uses mostly english words for the different elements. However, the way in which JS interacts with HTML is so far very confusing. That said, I am glad to really be digging into some actual coding, instead of just arranging HTML and CSS, as fun as that is. Javascript seems to be the door to more sophisticated programming.",
            "Also introduced in this week was CodeWars, which is a neat website that features bite-sized coding challenges that are almost like games or puzzles, and I look forward to digging into that deeper.

            "This week was quite challenging, and I was definitely feeling some pressure leading up to today's demo. This week we were tasked with creating two programs from scratch that implemented some functions we had not used before. The process of adding the elements of HTML, CSS, and Javascript together into one cohesive workflow is still pretty new to me, so I ended up having to rely on some of the previous projects as a rough template to complete the new ones. The results were a couple of Frankenstein's monsters that didn't look pretty, but get the job done.",
            "Most of the coding makes sense so far, but due to the breakneck pace we are pushing, it's difficult to get comfortable with anything, since as soon as we complete a project learning one skill we are immediately on to something else. It will be interesting to see how the pacing accelerates once we are meeting in person.",

Time management is always a key element that I'm always trying to improve.",
