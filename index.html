        <h4>Week 1: August 24 to 28:
    </h3>
    <p>Was my first week what I expected? Yes and no. Yes in terms of the fact that I had had a taste of what the
        bootcamp would be like in the course of completing the application project. In this project, I was
        tasked with using HTML to create a simple website with some basic text and images. Instead of detailed
        instructions,
        I was provided with links to sites that would provide the information I needed in order to complete each goal.
        The first week was similar to that except that the list of resources was far larger and the tasks much more
        complex. The
        major difference is that now I had the advantage of being able to access the instructers, Ian and Justin, as
        well
        as any if the 13 other students, for guidance or help via a program called Slack, an instant messaging system
        similar to an always-online chatroom. </p>
    <p>Were there struggles? Yes. The only way that the first week was NOT what I expected was in the sheer volume of
        content. It was definitely overwhelming, and while I was advised to
        expect up to 20 hours of work in the first week, it was certainly possible to spend far more
        time combing through the several seemingly bottomless links that were given as resources. In fact, I had to make
        a special effort
        to stay on task, as the material lends itself to wondering down rabbit holes. While this did lead to a bit of
        frustration,
        thankfully guidance was never far away. Also helpful was the daily check-in online conference calls which gave
        me chance to explain where I was having difficulty and learn from the experiences of other students. Overall,
        while
        I felt very challanged, I knew that I had help waiting in the wings if I did manage to get too deep in the
        weeds. </p>
    <p>What I'm excited to learn about in the coming weeks is how to continue to grow this initial knowledge into a
        toolbox for software development!
