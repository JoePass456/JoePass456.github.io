        <h4>Week 1: August 24 to 28</h4>
        <p>Was my first week what I expected? Yes and no. Yes in terms of the fact that I had had a taste of what the
            bootcamp would be like in the course of completing the application project. In this project, I was
            tasked with using HTML to create a simple website with some basic text and images. Instead of detailed
            instructions,
            I was provided with links to sites that would provide the information I needed in order to complete each
            goal.
            The first week was similar to that except that the list of resources was far larger and the tasks much more
            complex. The
            major difference is that now I had the advantage of being able to access the instructers, Ian and Justin, as
            well
            as any if the 13 other students, for guidance or help via a program called Slack, an instant messaging
            system
            similar to an always-online chatroom. </p>
        <p>Were there struggles? Yes. The only way that the first week was NOT what I expected was in the sheer volume
            of
            content. It was definitely overwhelming, and while I was advised to
            expect up to 20 hours of work in the first week, it was certainly possible to spend far more
            time combing through the several seemingly bottomless links that were given as resources. In fact, I had to
            make
            a special effort
            to stay on task, as the material lends itself to wondering down rabbit holes. While this did lead to a bit
            of
            frustration,
            guidance was never far away. Also helpful was the daily check-in online conference calls which gave
            me chance to explain where I was having difficulty and learn from the experiences of other students.
            Overall,
            while
            I felt very challanged, I knew that I had help waiting in the wings if I did manage to get too deep in the
            weeds. </p>
        <p>What I'm excited to learn about in the coming weeks is how to continue to grow this initial knowledge into a
            toolbox for software development!
        </p>
        <h4>Week One Summary:</h4>
        <p>Introduction to use of HTML, CSS, Slack, Git, Github, MAMP, Chrome Dev Tools, VS Code, and Terminal</p>
    </article>

        <h4>Week 2: Aug 31 to Sept 4</h4>
        <p>Week two is pretty much in the books. This week the main focus was on psuedocoding. This is a process of
            planning
            out your actual code in a more structured manner. This can be done with plain text or in a
            graphical
            format such as a flowchart, whether on computer or on a dry erase board. This allows the
            programmers
            to break the software into bite sized pieces that can be attacked one at a time instead of just jumping
            Rambo-style into the code without any plan.
        </p>
        <p>We also learned about the Agile philosophy, which is way to interact with your team and clients in a way that
            keeps the project
            moving steadily forward, and MoSCoW, which is a way to look at a program through
            the prism of what it Must do, what it Should do, what it Could do, and what it Won't do. This makes you look
            at
            your work
            in a more pragmatic fashion, so you prioritize getting the software up and running,
            and also
            helps you to figure out what features are going to be within the scope of the project, versus what might
            have to
            wait.</p>
        <p>What I've struggled with this week as much as anything else is simply managing my time. A week is not a long
            time, and
            if you have a couple of days where you don't get much accomplished, it can have you straining to catch up.
            Also,
            as we get
            closer to being fulltime in the classroom, I really want to be getting into the 8 to 5 schedule now, so it
            won't
            be a
            shock to
            my system when we do get to that stage.</p>
        <h4>Week Two Summary:</h4>
        <p>Introduction to pseudocode, Agile, MoSCoW, and deeper delving into HTML and CSS</p>
    </article>

        <h4>Week 3: Sept 7 to 11</h4>
        <p>This week started with Labor Day, which gave me a nice day to spend with family, but also meant that I was
            starting
            one day behind. This meant that I had to spend a lot of extra time to keep caught up with
            the material. While we had a lot of HTML and CSS to work on this week, the main focus was on
            Javascript(JS).
        </p>
        <p>I had only barely worked with JS before, but it does remind me a bit of working with BASIC way back in the
            90's,
            in that it uses mostly english words for the different elements. However, the way in which JS interacts with
            HTML
            is so far very confusing. That said, I am glad to really be digging into some actual coding, instead of just
            arranging HTML and CSS, as fun as that is. Javascript seems to be the door to more sophisticated
            programming.
        </p>
        <p>Also introduced in this week was CodeWars, which is a neat website that features bite-sized coding
            challenges that are almost like games or puzzles, and I look forward to digging into that deeper. Lastly,
            I've finally made some changes to my blog, making it look nicer and adding some functionality in the
            form of links and addition pages, which I will soon be filling in with content.
        </p>
        <p>My focus remains on improving my time management. At this point I already
            have way more material available than I can possibly cover, so I need to be sure I'm spending my time wisely
        </p>
        <h4>Week 3 Summary:</h4>
        <p>Introduction to Javascript, CodeWars, and pair programming, plus more HTML, CSS </p>

        <h4>Week 4: Sept 14 to 18</h4>
        <p>This was the last week of remote work before we move on-site to Awesome Inc's building in downtown Lexington.
            While I'll miss working from home in some ways, I'm excited to get started in the core bootcamp experience.
        </p>
        <p>This week was quite challenging, and I was definitely feeling some pressure leading up to today's demo. This
            week we were tasked with creating two programs from scratch that implemented some functions we had not used
            before. The process of adding the elements of HTML, CSS, and Javascript together into one cohesive workflow
            is still pretty new to me, so I ended
            up having to rely on some of the previous projects as a rough template to complete the new ones. The results
            were a couple
            of Frankenstein's monsters that didn't look pretty, but get the job done.
        </p>
        <p>Most of the coding makes sense so far, but due to the breakneck pace we are pushing, it's difficult to get
            comfortable with anything, since as soon as we complete a project learning one skill we are immediately on
            to something else. It will be interesting to see how the pacing accelerates once we are meeting in person.
        </p>
        <p>This weekend I intend to take one last breath before the plunge on monday. After that, it will be three
            months of
            intensity. I just hope all this knowledge will fit in my brain...
        </p>

    <h4>Week 5: Sept 21 to 25</h4>
    <p>This has been the first week on-site at Awesome Inc. It's been exciting working in close (closer, at least)
        proximity
        with the other bootcampers. Being here in person has created a new set of challenges, such as getting up in the
        morning, planning the commute, and figuring out how I'm going to feed myself though the course of the day.</p>
    <p>As always, the workload, including reading and projects is overwhelming. I'm trying to make a point to spend
        my time productively, but it's easy to get lost doing research and experimenting for hours only to realize
        that I've not really getting anything accomplished. Time management is always a key element that I'm always
        trying to
        improve.</p>

    <p>The subjects we've been concentrating on are Bootstrap, Javascript, and conceptualizing websites with atomic
        design, which is
        breaking down HTML into it's smallest form(atoms) and observing how to build them into bigger molecules and
        organisms.
        Projects for the week were to build a "mindreader" app that utilizes "states" and to create a "campaign" website
        for a fictional
        character. I choose Walter Sobchak from the Big Lewbowski.</p>
